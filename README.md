# Gameloop Montreal 2015 site.

(Psst, I added a `.nojekyll` file at the root of this repository -- that means you can just push regular HTML to it without having to follow the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) structure, but you can't use any of the other sorta-nice Jekyll-things like templates or tags. Just delete that file if you want to re-enable Jekyll.)
